#The replace_ending function replaces the old string in a sentence with
#the new string, but only if the sentence ends with the old string.
#If there is more than one occurrence of the old string in the sentence,
#only the one at the end is replaced, not all of them.
#For example, replace_ending("abcabc", "abc", "xyz") should return abcxyz, not xyzxyz or xyzabc.
#The string comparison is case-sensitive, so replace_ending("abcabc", "ABC", "xyz")
#should return abcabc (no changes made). 

def replace_ending(sentence, old, new):
	# Check if the old string is at the end of the sentence
	if sentence.endswith(old):
		# Using i as the slicing index, combine the part
		# of the sentence up to the matched string at the
		# end with the new string
		i = sentence.rstrip(old)
		new_sentence = i+new
		return new_sentence

	# Return the original sentence if there is no match
	return sentence
